# Binary Search

In binary search, a sorted array is divided in the middle. Then the target is checked if it's on the left side or the right side by comparison or at the middle of the array.
If it's greater than the middle value, the left side of the array is discarded and the array is divided again finding a new middle point. This is done until the middle part matches the target.
